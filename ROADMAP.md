# Roadmap

## Runtime Bridges
- [ ] Unify NodeBridge and OptimizedNodeBridge behind a shared JSONL transport core.
- [ ] Preserve NodeBridge semantics as the baseline (correctness-first, explicit errors).
- [ ] Make performance features opt-in (process pooling, caching) so defaults stay safe.
- [ ] When parity is achieved, keep NodeBridge as a thin alias over the unified core.
